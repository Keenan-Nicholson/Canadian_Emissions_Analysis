# Canadian_Emissions_Analysis
***A work in progress***

A project for COMP3400 at Memorial University of Newfoundland where I analyze the following dataset -   
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles. The goal of this project is 
to predict the level of CO2 emissions outputted by a vehicle based on several features the car has (for example, transmission type, fuel type, fuel consumption, vehicle make etc). This dataset is very nice, so for demonstration purposes I have created artificial outliers and anomalies in the dataset.
