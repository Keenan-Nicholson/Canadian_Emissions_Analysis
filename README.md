# Canadian_Emissions_Analysis

A project for COMP3400 at Memorial University of Newfoundland where we analyze the following dataset -   
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles. Our goal of this project is 
predicting CO2 emissions and fuel efficiency based on which features a car has. For now, we have created
outliers and fuzz in the dataset for the sole purpose of showing we can remove them for educational purposes. 
When we move on to part 2 -- the goal of the project -- this will be removed and just the analysis  of the 
original dataset will remain as it was quite clean to begin with.
